# Restaurant-Reservation-Chatbot-
# 🚀 Restaurant Chatbot using BERT  

This project implements a **restaurant reservation chatbot** powered by **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**. The chatbot can understand user queries, classify intents, and generate appropriate responses for tasks like **checking the menu, making reservations, placing orders, and handling payments**.  

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Intent Classification** using fine-tuned BERT model.  
✅ **Handles multiple restaurant-related queries** (menu, reservations, orders, payment options).  
✅ **Custom dataset support** for training new intents.  
✅ **Modular design** with separate scripts for training, inference, and chatbot interaction.  
✅ **Supports GPU acceleration** for faster training.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/restaurant-chatbot-bert.git
cd restaurant-chatbot-bert
2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
sh
Copy
Edit
python -m venv chatbot_env
source chatbot_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use chatbot_env\Scripts\activate
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
📊 Dataset Format
The chatbot is trained using a CSV file containing labeled data.

Example dataset (data/dataset.csv):
Text	Label
Show me the menu	Check Menu
How can I pay?	Check Payment Options
I want to book a table	Make Reservation
Can I change my reservation?	Modify Reservation
Goodbye	Farewell
📝 Custom Dataset: You can update dataset.csv with new examples to train the model on additional intents.

📌 Training the Model
To train the chatbot on the dataset:

sh
Copy
Edit
python train.py
This will:
✔ Load the dataset from data/dataset.csv
✔ Tokenize the text using BERT tokenizer
✔ Train a BERT model for intent classification
✔ Save the trained model in models/bert_model/

📈 Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model:

sh
Copy
Edit
python evaluate.py
This will:
✔ Run the model on the validation dataset
✔ Compute accuracy and loss

🤖 Running the Chatbot
Once the model is trained, start the chatbot:

sh
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
✔ The chatbot will load the trained BERT model
✔ It will classify user queries and generate appropriate responses

🎯 Making Predictions (Standalone Inference)
To test individual sentences:

sh
Copy
Edit
python inference.py
or modify inference.py and run:

python
Copy
Edit
from inference import predict_intent
print(predict_intent("I want to book a table for tonight"))
🚀 Future Improvements
🔹 Add support for more restaurant-related intents
🔹 Improve model accuracy with larger datasets
🔹 Deploy the chatbot as a web or mobile app
